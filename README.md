Ultrasurf might make certain school platforms unusable like Infinite Campus or NWEA so make sure you turn it off in the windows proxy settings.
Ultrasurf uses http proxies to bypass the school and or goverment if anyone is wondering.

Proof that proxy is not a trojan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bglcdjtnMi0
